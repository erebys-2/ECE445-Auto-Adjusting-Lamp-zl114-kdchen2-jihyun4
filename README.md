#ECE445 FA25 Project: Auto-Adjusted Smart Lighting System for Healthy Indoor Environments

Team: zl114, kdchen2, jihyun4

#Introduction:

Prolonged desk work under poor lighting can lead to eye strain, headaches, and fatigue. Most desk lamps are static, requiring manual adjustment and offering no adaptation to daylight changes or different tasks. A smart desk lamp that dynamically controls both brightness and color temperature could provide healthier, more comfortable lighting.

Our solution is a smart desk lamp with sensors and a controller that automatically adjusts both illuminance (lux level) and color temperature.

#Results:

Coming soon
